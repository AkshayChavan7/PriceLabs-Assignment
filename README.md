# PriceLabs take-home assignment

**Problem Statement -** 
1.  In the "request.txt" attachment you will find the API call that should give you the data for a particular lat/lng, use the same request but change the request to find listings for Paris. I have also added the response_vrbo.json file so that you can understand how the response will look for any coordinates.
2.  Please use modern JavaScript/HTML/CSS standards to create a layout that looks like the "first.png" screenshot, preferable to use React or Angular or anything that you are comfortable with.
3.  Bonus: Check out the "second.png" file that shows filters, when clicked should only show those listings that satisfy the category. For example, if you have 3-5 bedrooms selected and 2-4 bathrooms selected then only those listings that have both conditions satisfied should be shown and no other listings should show.
4.  Bonus: Drawing a square/rectangle on the map against a group of listings should only show the listings that are inside the boundary on the left-hand side ("third" screenshot)
5.  Bonus: Check out the  [v](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j2460ue56vs7rlc/Click_On_Listings_On_Map.mov?dl=0)ideo that shows you how clicking/hovering on a listing shows you the listing on the map and also clicking on the map will scroll to the listing on the left side.
